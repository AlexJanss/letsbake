#Let's bake 
A React Rative app for increasing the baking adventure.

##Goal
Develop an app, that helps to plan baking times. Sometimes I ask myself when should I begin to mix all ingredients 
together, if I want to get my beloved pizza/bread/cake at a specifc time.

##Tools


##Getting started
Build with expo and react native, this app works with TypeScript and shall run on Android and iOS.

To start the emulator run the following commans

- `yarn start` or `expo start` # you can open iOS, Android, or web from here, or run them directly with the commands below.
- `yarn android` or `expo start --android`
- `yarn ios` or `expo start --ios`# requires an iOS device or macOS for access to an iOS simulator
- `yarn web` or `expo start --web`
